          Initially I had the idea that I would write this site like I used to do it â€” in plain old HTML and SCSS. And I did write it that way at first. But then I had to write my own media query mixins and utility classes and that really sucked the fun right out.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          So, now this site is written in plain old HTML and SCSS and Tailwind. It was built with Jekyll, a Ruby static site generator, and is hosted on Github Pages.

          This site is black and yellow because I've always liked black and yellow. It was typeset in Inter by Rasmus Andersson.
