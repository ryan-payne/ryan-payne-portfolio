          I had an idea that I would write this site like I used to do it â€” in plain old HTML and SCSS. And I did write it that way at first. But then I started writing my own media query mixins (which absolutely sucks) and I was spending way too much time writing my own utility classes.

        <p class="mb-6">
          So now this site is written in plain old HTML and SCSS but with the help of Tailwind. It was built with Jekyll, a Ruby static site generator, and is hosted on Github Pages.

          This site was typeset in Inter by Rasmus Andersson.

          Inter is a typeface carefully crafted & designed for computer screens. It features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and lower-case text.
