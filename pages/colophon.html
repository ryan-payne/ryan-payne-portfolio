          <h3>The Tech Stuff</h3>
          <p>
            This site was written in plain old HTML and SCSS (like we used to do it), was built with Jekyll, a Ruby static site generator, and is hosted on Github Pages.
          </p>
          <p>I used Bootstrap's grid and utility classes.</p>
          <h3>The Design Stuff</h3>
          <p>
            This site was typeset in Inter by Rasmus Andersson.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inter is a typeface carefully crafted & designed for computer screens. It features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and lower-case text.
