          <p>
            Untappd for Business gives business owners the ability to quickly build menus and publish them to their website, digital menus, and the Untappd app. Businesses can also engage directly with users in the Untappd app using check-ins, events, social media sharing, and more.
          </p>

          <h3>About Untappd</h3>
          <p>
            Untappd is a social networking service and mobile application that allows its 9 million users to check in as they drink beers, earn badges based on check-ins, and share these check-ins and their locations with their friends.
          </p>

          <h3>Project Background</h3>
          <p>
            Untappd’s focus has primarily been on beer consumers. With more adoption and check-in activity on the Untappd platform and no increased focus on breweries or venues, leadership identified an opportunity to serve businesses in the hospitality space.
          </p>

          <h3>Opportunity Space</h3>
          <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>
              <p>
                Businesses don’t have control over what beers are checked-in at their venues causing confusion among the Untappd community about inventory availability.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Breweries and venues don’t have a way to directly engage with Untappd users in a meaningful way.
              </p>

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>
            Based on research from the marketing team, we were able to identify key features and functionality the product should have, as well as key insights into competitors' products. I built and tested a series of prototypes that addressed the needs and pain points of potential users and incorporated relevant feedback into subsequent iterations.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Based on prototype testing and additional user interviews, we built an all-in-one menu publishing toolkit that syncs social accounts, websites, print and digital menus, and Untappd profiles in one click. Businesses save time by posting content to Facebook & Twitter pages from the Untappd for Business dashboard. Untappd for Business partners stand out on the app by showcasing events and specials, and alerting subscribers to new beers and events via push notifications.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>
            Untappd for Business boasts over 15,000 Verified Venues.
