          <h3>Project Background</h3>
          <p>
            Clarke Power Services planned to phase out use of APPX for it's invoicing platform. They wanted to build a custom web app allowing for more scalable and flexible architecture, making it easier to add new features, integrate with third-party tools, and perform maintenance and updates.
          </p>

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            The product team at Clarke had a clear understanding of the current invoicing product but needed help understanding how a new app might function and what could be improved for its users across business units.

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>
            I teamed up with a project manager and business analyst to interview users across three business units â€” all with slightly different processes, create journey maps, identify top tasks and test high-fidelity prototypes. 
          </p>
  
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Through interviews we learned that it was important not to deliver a product that didn't totally do away with patterns users were used to and relied on to do their job quickly. Based on prototype testing, we built a new web app utilizing UI patterns familiar to users and building upon them to improve previously painful processes.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>
            We measured customer satisfaction with Google's HEART framework and saw high user satisfaction scores, low error rates, and decreased time-on-task.
