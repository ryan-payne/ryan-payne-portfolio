        <p class="mb-8">
          I grew up in Southeast Tennessee and live in Cincinnati. That means I have Southern charm and Midwestern grit. I’m a dad, an avid home coffee roaster, an ok guitar and banjo player, and I love a good trap beat. I use Oxford commas.
        </p>
  
        <p class="mb-6">
          I’ve been working with web and native applications for 15 years and have significant experience in branding, illustration, technical writing, and customer support.
